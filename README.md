## Suggestions to Improve Efficient Writing and Editing In-Company
This outline is to help companies develop a strategy for efficient writing. It is a basic foundation on which companies can build their own solutions.  

### Four-step approach to improve writing efficiency 
    - Formatted templates
    - Onboarding course
    - Advanced group courses
    - Personalized feedback tracking

#### 1. Formatted templates
*Create and maintain a robust library/repository of templates to allow employees to write more efficiently.* 

    - Formatted templates to create consistency and streamline specific writing tasks 
      - (audits, presentations, thought pieces, blog posts, etc.)
    - Language templates for researchers and engineers to import & structure findings more efficiently
      - Build a repository of phrases, vocab, types of sentences (transitions, topic sentences, clarifying language, etc.)

#### 2. Onboarding coaching
*Offer a general group course that follows a fixed syllabus (could do one every quarter for new employees).*

##### a. Know your audience
    - Tones, style, voice, 
    - Formality
    - Technical knowledge + vocabulary
##### b. What’s the purpose?
    - Why am I telling you this?
    - Why do you need to listen?
    - What’s the call to action?
##### c. The importance of structure
    - Thesis statements
    - Topic sentences
    - Linking words
    - Transitions
##### d. Being concise
    - Less is more
    - Precise vocabulary
    - Conveying complex ideas simply


#### 3. Advanced group courses 
*Any employee can opt into for more advanced writing techniques (topics can be selected or 'voted on' by employees).*
  
    - Parallel structure
    - Participle clauses
    - Adverbs
    - Punctuation & titles
    - Writing for presentations
    - Rhetoric (for more persuasive writing)
    - Etc. 

#### 4. Personalized feedback tracking
*For any employee who wants individual coaching on feedback I’ve given them or other communication topics they’re concerned about. Could have recurring monthly lessons or hold “office hours” that people sign up for on given days/times.* 

     - Everything English related!
       - Being assertive/diplomatic, creative writing, user-specific grammar, presentations, etc.
